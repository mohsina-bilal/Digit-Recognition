Sklearn Logistic Regression for Digit Recognition

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This project utilizes Scikit-learn's logistic regression algorithm to recognize digits from the Scikit-learn digits dataset.

## Description

The goal of this project is to build a machine-learning model using logistic regression to accurately classify handwritten digits. The Scikit-learn library provides a built-in dataset called "digits" that consists of 8x8 images of digits ranging from 0 to 9. Each image is represented as a 64-dimensional feature vector, where each feature corresponds to a pixel intensity value.

The logistic regression algorithm is a popular and widely used classification algorithm. It works by fitting a logistic function to the training data and then using that function to predict the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class. In this case, the logistic regression model will learn to predict the digit represented by an input image.

The project involves the following steps:

1. Loading the Scikit-learn digits dataset.
2. Preprocessing the data, which may include scaling, normalization, or feature extraction.
3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Training the logistic regression model using the training data.
5. Evaluating the model's performance on the testing data.
6. Making predictions on new, unseen images of digits.

The accuracy of the model will be assessed based on its ability to correctly classify digits from the testing set. The project will provide insights into the effectiveness of logistic regression for digit recognition and serve as a foundation for further exploration of image classification tasks.

## Installation

To run this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or above)
- Scikit-learn

You can install Scikit-learn using pip:

```
pip install scikit-learn
```
Once you have the dependencies installed, you can proceed with running the code and following the instructions in the [Usage](#usage) section.

## Usage

To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the [Installation](#installation) section.

2. Import the necessary modules in your Python script:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

3. Load the digits dataset using `load_digits()` function:

```python
digits = load_digits()
```

4. Preprocess the data if needed, such as scaling, normalization, or feature extraction.

5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`:

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(digits.data, digits.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

6. Create an instance of the logistic regression model:

```python
model = LogisticRegression()
```

7. Train the model using the training data:

```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

8. Evaluate the model's accuracy on the testing data:

```python
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

9. Make predictions on new, unseen images using the trained model.
